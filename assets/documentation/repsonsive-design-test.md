In this section, we have created a table to show the responsive design of the our element game webpage across different devices. With validation and lighthouse result images.
Responsive web design (RWD) is a web design approach to *make web pages render well on all screen sizes and resolutions* while ensuring good usability.

Below here is the table for the website's user interface responsiveness in its early build:
